# Alacritty Startup
A little helper program I use to set some Alacritty config options based what my current setup is. If i'm using two monitors chances are I want the font size to be bigger since i have the bigger monitor further away.

## Installation
### Linux
```bash
./install.sh
```


### Windows
Install a better operating system.
